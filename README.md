This is a mobile application developed with React Native during [Full Stack Open Part 10](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part10).

The app allows users to explore repositories and submit reviews for them. It leverages the [Rate Repository API](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/rate-repository-api), a GraphQL backend offering endpoints for managing repositories, reviews, and user authentication.

This project demonstrates relevant concepts such as building a React Native app with Expo, integrating a GraphQL backend using Apollo Client, writing tests for components and implementing cursor-based pagination.
